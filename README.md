Hi...Thanks for checking my project.

Things you need for project

vscode

1.Install vscode (make sure to check-in open with vscode option in context menu)

2.python (Install python..make sure to set Path and also install/upgrade pip)

3.Django (Now that you have pip, run 'pip install django' in cmd)

4.Packages (run 'pip install Pandas' in cmd,similarly Tweepy, NLTK, textBlob...also other packages that are suggested  when you run django server...)

Why vscode ? ....Because you can download extensions and most importantly you can open a terminal within the workspace saves time....you can still use other text editors...I prefer vs code.

How to use Django?....
step 1: When you download and extract the zip file, go through the directory untill you find manage.py.
step 2: Once in there , right click your mouse and open with vsode...now in vs code open terminal ( ctrl + ~ ).. Type " **python manage.py runserver** "

I guess it didn't run on first try..maybe a few setup is left..let me guide you through it..

You get to use only sentiment analysis for now.
