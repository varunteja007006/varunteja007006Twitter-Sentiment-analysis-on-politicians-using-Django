# varunteja007006Twitter-Sentiment-analysis-on-politicians-using-Django

Hi...Thanks for checking my project.

things you want

vscode

1.Install vscode (make sure to check-in open with vscode option in context menu)

2.python (Install python..make sure to set Path and also install/upgrade pip)

3.Django (Now that you have pip,run 'pip install django' in cmd)

4.Packages (run 'pip install Pandas' in cmd,similarly Tweepy, NLTK)

Why vscode ? ....Because you can download extensions and most importantly you can open a terminal within the workspace saves time....you can still use other text editors.

How to use Django?....

#What do you get to use in this project?

You get to use only sentiment analysis for now.
